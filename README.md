    Gradle Type: DLS

    Language: Kotlin

    Architechture Pattern: MVVM

    Dependency Injection: Koin-2.0.1
    Http Client: OkHttp-4.9.0
    Http Client: Retrofit-2.9.0
    Concurrency Library: Coroutine-1.4.2
    Reactive Extensions: RxJava2 (2.2.10)

    Navigation Component: 2.3.5
    Room: 2.3.0-alpha03
    Unit Test: koin-test:2.0.1
    
  
   App Test Credential: (or create a new user account)
   
    username: sincere@april.biz
    password: password1
    
    

USER API: 
         
         * The users list can be obtained at using this endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users  in JSON format, and a total of 10 users. 

FEATURES: 
          
          * When you run the app for the first time it will access first the endpoint API then persist the user data to room (SQLite). 
          To login the cartrack app you may use the email as username and password: `password+n` sample username: `sincere@april.biz` password: `password1` 
          the n'th is the user id.  
          
          * In case of failure to fetch from end point due to 404, 403, 500 or other server failure, a simple fallback was integrated to shift from end-point to local (car_owners.json)
          
          * You can also add user and sign-up can be found in login screen.
          * Profile user can be modify or edit.
          
          * Paging was not coded due to time limit and endpoint does not have pagination. 
          * Search features are not yet integrated due to time limitation of the app development.
